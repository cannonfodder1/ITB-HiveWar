,Personality,Character guidelines for chatter,"
Artificial pilots are assigned to mechs as a last resort in combat. While they are capable of fighting, Mechs excel and become better when manned by a human pilot (or Pinnacle A.I., which are far more advanced). Artificial pilots are often present in the corporate islands, but not accorded the same status nor have the same extent of personality that the Pinnacle robots do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
