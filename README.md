# ITB-HiveWar

This project is a mod for Into The Breach, a recently released turn-based strategy game about time-travelling mechs fighting giant bugs crawling up from the underground. The mod adds a new enemy type that is not only significantly harder than existing enemies, but also periodically upgrades as the player moves through the game. This is a big project as the base game does not support such an upgrade system, and I had to create it from scratch. The enemy also has the unique ability to attack on the player's turn, something else that is not normally supported.

Please note that all the files in the ModApiExt folder are not mine. The Mod API Extension is a community library of functions that I am utilizing to help create this mod.
